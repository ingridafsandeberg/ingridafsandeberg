- 👋 Hi, I’m @ingridafsandeberg
- 👀 I’m interested in basically everything (incurable polynerd). I've always worked in the intersection between tech and business, 
but coming from the business side, I wanted to deepen my technical knowledge - hence:
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science basics (CS50 at Harvard)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!
- 📫 How to reach me ping me on twitter - ingridafs - or on linkedin
